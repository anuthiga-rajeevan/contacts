# Contacts
## Welcome

This project is just to show case my knowledge in node.js and react.js. Anyone can register to the application using valid email address and login to the application. After login they can add, edit, view and delete contacts.

### Current Code & Structure

The application is split into two parts, the server (BE) and the client (FE).

### Steps to follow for getting up & running


1) `npm i` in root directory
2) `cd server`
3) `npm i` in server folder
4) `cd ../client`
5) `npm i` in client folder
6) `cd ..`
7) `npm run start` in root directory will run both client and server concurrently


### How to run tests
1) `npm run test:client` in root folder will run FE tests
2) `npm run test:server` in root folder will run BE tests
